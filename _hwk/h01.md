<b>READING ASSIGNMENT</b>

Please read {{page.desc}}.  Then complete these problems and turn in your completed homework in lecture on the due date.

Section 2.1 describes how several operators and built in functions in
Python work.  What would be the result of entering the following at
the Python interactive shell prompt?

(Note: You are encouraged to check your answers at the Python prompt
before turning in your work, but try this on paper first, just by
reading the text and trying to predict what will happen.  Then try
typing in the results at the Python prompt. Change your answers if
they were mistaken, but even more important, try to figure out why you
were incorrect.)

Be very precise.  Note that `True` is not the same in Python as `true`; upper
vs. lower case matters.  You will not get full credit for answers that are not
precisely correct.

(5 pts) As described in section 2.1, a Python assignment statement contains the assignment operator, an expression and a variable, but not in that order.

What is the correct order for these three parts, reading from left to right?

<li style="margin-bottom:5em;" markdown="1">
(5 pts) Section 2.1 contains a list of thirty-three <em>reserved words</em> in Python that may not be used as the name of a variable. You don't need to memorize this list, but you do need to know where to find it, either in the book, or online.  So, to be sure you can find it, list all of the Python reserved words that start with the letter `e` or `r`.

<li style="margin-bottom:5em;" markdown="1">
Section 2.2 describes strings in Python, including the concepts of "dictionary order" (also called "lexicographic order"), concatenation of strings, multiplication of strings times an integer, the `in` operator, the `not in` operation, the `len` function, and string indexing.  Review that material.

Then, assuming the following assignment statements have been entered at the Python prompt:

```python
school = "UCSB"
course = "CS8"
qtr = "W18"
```

Indicate the value of each of these expressions:

<style>
div.evenbigger table * td { padding: 2em 1pt 2em 1pt; text-align: center; }
div.evenbigger table * th { padding: 0em 1pt 0em 1pt; margin: 0 0 0 0;
  text-align:center;}
div.evenbigger table * td code { padding: 0pt 1em 0pt 1em; }
span.wider { padding: 0pt 6em 0pt 6em; }
</style>


<div class="evenbigger" markdown="1">

| | Expression  | <span class="wider">Result</span> | | | Expression  | <span class="wider">Result</span> |
|---------|-------------|--------|-|--------|-------------|--------|
| (4 pts) | `school * 2`        |  | | (4 pts) | `school > course` | |
| (4 pts) | `qtr[1:3]`          |  | |(4 pts) | `qtr < school`   | |
| (4 pts) | `course[0:2]`        |  | |(4 pts) | `len(qtr) > 4`   | |
| (4 pts) | `'D' in school`     |  | |(4 pts) | `school[-1]`     | |
| (4 pts) | `'E' not in school` |  | |(4 pts) | `school[0]`      | |
