<b>READING ASSIGNMENT</b>

Please read {{page.desc}}.  Then complete these problems and turn in your completed homework in lecture on the due date.

Section 2.3 describes lists and tuples in Python.  Assuming the following assignment statements have been entered at the Python prompt:

```python
schools = ("UCSB","Stanford","MIT","UCLA","Cal Tech")
schedules = [ ["CMPSC 8","MATH 3A"], ["CMPSC 8","PSTAT 5A"],["MATH 3B"] ]
units = [4, 4, 8]
```

What would be the result of entering the following at
the Python interactive shell prompt?

(Note: You are encouraged to check your answers at the Python prompt
before turning in your work, but try this on paper first, just by
reading the text and trying to predict what will happen. Then try
typing in the results at the Python prompt. Change your answers if
they were mistaken, but even more important, try to figure out why you
were incorrect).

Be very precise.  Note that `True` is not the same in Python as `true`; upper
vs. lower case matters.  You will not get full credit for answers that are not
precisely correct.  And note that `"UCSB"` and `["UCSB"]` are not the same in Python&mdash;one is a string, and the other is a list of length one containing a single string.

<li style="margin-bottom:10em;" markdown="1">
(5 pts) As described in section 2.3, lists and tuples are similar, but there are two big differences.  One is that lists are written with square brackets `[]` while tuples are written with parentheses `()`. What is the other big difference between lists and tuples?


</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:10em;" markdown="1">
(5 pts) Write a line of Python code that assigns the variable `mySchool` to have a value that is a <strong>tuple</strong> of length 1, containing the single string `"UCSB"`.


</li>



<li markdown="1"> Assume that the following sequence of statements has been
entered at the Python prompt.  Note that subsequent statements may
change the value of the variables (e.g. `colors` is altered by the
call to the `append` method)

```python
colors = ["red","green","green"]
colors.append("orange")
colors.reverse()
```

  text-align:center;}
div.evenbigger table * td code { padding: 0pt 1em 0pt 1em; }
span.wider { padding: 0pt 6em 0pt 6em; }
