# Namedtuple Review

```
from collections import namedtuple

Book = namedtuple("Book", "title author price") # define Book model
b1 = Book("Harry Potter", "JK Rowling", 10) # construct Book object

print(b1.title) # Use attribute name instead of b1[0]
```


# More on loops


```
name = "Bob"
for c in name:
    print(c)
    print("----")

print("resuming program execution")
```

# range function

- `range()` is a function used for looping if we know
  the number of iterations we want to make.
- `range(x)` returns a collection of numbers including
  `0` up to (but not including) `x`
- Think of `range(4)` as `[0, 1, 2, 3]`



# Example using range()

```
for x in range(4):
    print("Hello!" * x)
    print("----")
```


# Example looping from numbers 2, 3, 4, 5 using range

```
for x in range(2,6):
    print(x)
    print("----")
```

* `range` is similar to substring
  * 1st parameter defines the 1st number
  * loops up to (but not including) the 2nd parameter's number


# Example using range with steps

```
for x in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(x)
    print("----")
```


# Example by manually updating a variable in the loop

```
intList = [2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,1024]
counter = 1
for x in intList:
    print("2 ^ ", counter, "=", x)
    counter = counter + 1
```

# Nested Control Structures

- We can nest statements within each control structure
  (so far, we've seen if / for)
- This helps define "control" of statement execution in
  different ways.
- Each block of statements within a control structure is
  defined by indentation.


# Example

```
listOfNames = ["Bender", "Fry", "Leela", "Morbo"]
robots = ["Bender", "Calculon"]
humans = ["Hermes", "Fry", "Amy"]
aliens = ["Morbo", "Lurr"]

print("Checking Futurama characters with species")
for name in listOfNames:
    if name in robots:
        print(name + " is a robot")
    else:
        if name in humans:
            print(name + " is a human")
        else:
            if name in aliens:
                print(name + " is an alien")
            else:
                print("Hmm, not sure what " + name + " is")

```

Functionally, this looks fine, but you can imagine the
structure of the code becomming really messy when there
are A LOT of possible species

Python has the `elif` statement that means "else if"

```
for name in listOfNames:
    if name in robots:
        print(name + " is a robot")
    elif name in humans:
        print(name + " is a human")
    elif name in aliens:
        print(name + " is an alien")
    else:
        print("Hmm, not sure what " + name + "is")
```


# Example: Write a function and run some assert tests

```
def hasOddNumber(list):
    ''' Returns True if the list has an odd number.
        Returns False otherwise
    '''
    for x in list:
        if (x % 2 != 0):
            return True
    return False

numbers1 = [2,4,5,6,8]
numbers2 = [0,10,20,30]
numbers3 = []

# Test by observation
print(hasOddNumber(numbers1))
print(hasOddNumber(numbers2))
print(hasOddNumber(numbers3))

# Test by assertions
assert hasOddNumber(numbers1) == True
assert hasOddNumber(numbers2) == False
assert hasOddNumber(numbers3) == False

# Can also define test_ functions for pytest...
```


# User Defined Modules

- Recall how we can import other people's code (including
  your own) in our programming files
- You might notice something like `if __name__=="__main__":`
  - This line of code makes importing modules easier
    and doesn't include code that may not want to be reused
  - Good for importing function definitions, and not
    initializing variables, calling print statements, etc.
- For an example, see <https://ucsb-cs8.github.io/ptopics/main_blocks/>
