# CS 8, 2-15-18

''' Recap
- While loops
- Break statement
- Continue statement

- The "pass" statement
    - Considered a "no-op" (no-operation). Doesn't do
    anything, but some functions or conditions require
    a statement for legal syntax.

# Example
def f():
    pass

print(f())

# Note: exiting a function without a return statement
# is OK, but the return value is None if the function
# doesn't return anything.

x = 6
if x > 5:
    pass # if this is removed, then a syntax error!
else:
    print(x, "<= 5")
print("continue execution...")

# In general, I find that I rarely use "pass" statements
# we can write code to avoid having pass statements.

# Example - A number guessing game

magicNumber = 40
guess = input("Guessing Game!\nPlease enter an int \
between 0 - 100 (type 'exit' to end game): ")

while True:
    if guess == "exit":
        print("Game over!")
        break
    number = int(guess)
    if number < 0 or number > 100:
        guess = input("Invalid number. Please try again: ")
        continue
    if number < magicNumber:
        guess = input("Too small. Please try again: ")
        continue
    if number > magicNumber:
        guess = input("Too big. Please try again: ")
        continue
    if number == magicNumber:
        print("Winner winner, chicken dinner!")
        print("You guessed", magicNumber)
        break
print("Done.")

''' Two-dimensional Lists (2D Lists)
- Normal Lists: One number is used to index an item
    - Think of it as a straight line from 0 to N-1 elements
- 2D Lists
    - Think of it as a table where two numbers (two
    dimensions), represented with a row and column
    can index the items.
    - Elements can have some logical mapping with respect
    to the row / column value

- Conceptual example
    - Computer screens can be represented in a Grid of
    pixels
    - Basic color screens can have color values
    (Red, Green, Blue) for different colors
    - Monochrome screens (black and white) can be represented
    as a Grid of black / white pixels
