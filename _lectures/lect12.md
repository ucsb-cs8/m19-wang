''' A few notes about Lab07
- Lab07 uses tuples as a way to organize certain data.
- One of the requirements isto print certain data in
descending order
- We talked about sorting lists
'''

L = ["b","c","a"]
L.sort()
print(L)

# but what if we had a list of tuples? How would the list sort
# these items?

L = [(1,3),(3,2),(3,1),(3,3),(0,1)]
L.sort()
print(L)

# by default, list.sort() will sort the first value and then by
# the 2nd value in the case of a tie.
# We can reverse the sorting order (descending instead of ascending)

L.sort(reverse=True)
print(L)

''' Dictionaries
- New Tool: DICTIONARIES
- Otherwise known as TABLES or MAPS
    - Works where a KEY maps to a VALUE
    - Use dictionaries for two main reasons:
        - Gives us more precise indexing than Lists
        - L['someString'] - allows us to index elements
        based on some key
        - Performance is MUCH better than searching through
        Lists.
            - keys are HASHED to a specific index value
                - keys are passed through some math equation
                and an index is computed
                - Provides DIRECT ACCESS to the value given a
                key.
            - Details of hashing is not discussed in this class,
            but you may see it sometime...
'''
''' Syntax for Dictionaries
{<key1>:<value1>,<key2>:<value2>, ... , <keyn>:valuen>}
'''

D = {} # Empty dictionary. Notice the curly braces instead of []

D = {'Jane':18, 'Jen':19, 'Joe':20, 'John':21}

'''
print(D)
print("Jane's age is:", D['Jane'])
print(len(D))

# Simple way to get key / value
for x in D:
    print(x) # Prints the keys
    print(D[x]) # Prints the values
'''
''' Restrictions on using Dictionaries
- Keys must be an immutable type (int, str, namedtuples, - not
lists for example).
- Values can be anything (mutable or immutable objects)
- For our purposes, KEYS are UNIQUE. Don't define something like
{'Joe':17, 'Joe':18}.
- Python is actually OK with duplicate keys and it will return
the last key/value in the dictionary.
- Again, for our purposes, we should never use duplicate key
values (kinda defeats the purpose of dictionaries).
'''

''' dictionary methods
    D.pop(key) # remove and return the value
    D.update(D2) # combine values in D and D2
    D.get(key) # returns item if it exists. If not, returns None or a default value
    D.keys() # dict_keys([ LIST OF KEYS ])
    D.values() # dict_values([ LIST OF VALUES ])
    D.items() # dict_items([ LIST OF KEY,VALUE ])
'''
'''
value = D.pop('John')
print(D)

D.update({'Jess':25,'Jerry':27})
print(D)

# What if something is not in the dictionary and we try to access it?
#print(D["CS8"]) #ERROR - "CS8" key doesn't exist.
print(D.get("CS8"))

# Can define the default return value if key doesn't exist
print(D.get("CS8", "not in dictionary!"))

print(D.keys())

'''
'''
for item in D.keys():
    print(item)
'''
'''
keys = D.keys()
#print(keys[2]) # ERROR - Not a list!
print(list(keys)[2]) # OK
'''
''' Views ARE NOT LISTS!
Some properties of Views
- They are like "windows" to the contents of the dictionary
- They are self-updating and shows what the current state is
'''
'''
print(D.items())
x = D.items()
D.pop('Jerry')
print(x)
# x does not have 'Jerry' even though it was initialized
# before pop()

# Example of adding to a dictionary
D = {}
print(D)
D['CS8'] = "UCSB"
print(D)
D['CS16'] = "UCSB"
print(D)
'''
''' SETS: Like a mathematical set
- A collection of items with:
    - no duplicates
    - order and position does not matter
- Useful for certain problems
    - Keep track of unique items (active IDs, SSN, Driver's License)
- Under the hood, similar to the implementation of dictionaries
    - Uses hashing to map a set's value to a particular index
        - Instant lookup times (better than "walking down" the
        collection until you find the item).
Syntax:
{<value1>,<value2>,...,<valuen>}
'''
s = {1,2,3,4}
d = {'a':1, 'b':2}
print(type(s))
print(type(d))

empty_set = set()
empty_dict = {}
print(type(s))
print(type(d))

# create a set from a list
s2 = set([2,4,6,6])
print(s2)

# common set operators:
# in, not in

print(3 in s2)
print('what the?' in s2)
print('a' in d) # also works for dictionary keys
print(5 not in s2)
print(len(s2))

# Combine values from two sets:
s3 = set([4,5,6])
combined_set = s2 | s3
print(combined_set)

# Get the common elements from two sets:
intersecting_set = s2 & s3
print(intersecting_set)

# Remove elements of a set from another set
difference_set = s2 - s3 # {2}
print(difference_set)
difference_set = s3 - s2 # {5}
print(difference_set)
# order matters!

# Get unique items in two sets
