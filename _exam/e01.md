# Past Exams

* There are some past CS8 exams available here.
* <strong>NOTE:</strong> Use these sample exams as additional practice and anticipation of what kind of questions may be asked on the exams. I encourage everyone to work through the problems, but <b>DO NOT</b> base your studying only on these exams. I expect all students to review the material thoroughly.

* Link to Midterm 2 from W18: [M2](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~richert/cs8/exams/W18_M2.pdf)
    * Note: Due to the pace of the summer session, not all topics on Midterm 2 W18 will be covered before our Midterm.
* Link to Final from W18: [FINAL](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~richert/cs8/exams/W18_FINAL.pdf)

* More previous exams... be cautioned though that instructor styles vary, different textbooks have been used for the course, and the exact coverage of topics varies over time.
